## Authors

Currently almost(?) everything (all functions, files, text) in this repository are made by me @ActualizeInMaterial and I've dedicated this repository to public domain.

This readme is originally from: https://github.com/davispuh/CLI-Console/blob/master/README.md

## Unlicense

![Copyright-Free](https://unlicense.org/pd-icon.png)

All text, documentation, code and files in this repository are in public domain (including this text, README).
It means you can copy, modify, distribute and include in your own work/code, even for commercial purposes, all without asking permission.

[About Unlicense](https://unlicense.org/)
 
This kinda explains the why: https://github.com/twolfson/twolfson.com/blob/c59f67c1336be5c5788842539ce8679e54e9845d/articles/unlicense-all-the-things.md
 
 If you're wondering why CC0 might be preferred? Who knows: https://github.com/FailMan3D/shsls-spacecraft/blob/7cff5b4b6405f242749e8787e595d463dbbd67a2/LICENSE.note Also see the previous link(on the why).
 
I also added CC0 (in the file LICENSE) which should be the same thing(=public domain)! So for those who have a problem with Unlicense, they can pick CC0. Assume this is released under both(or either) - the result is the same: public domain! So pick the one you're confortable with and assume this is released under it. There! Free enough??! ;-) Have fun!
